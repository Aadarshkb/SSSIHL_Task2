**TASK 4:**

OBSERVING WAVEFORMS IN GTKWAVE FOR RISC-V SIMULATION:

After running the Verilog simulation, the results are saved in a VCD (Value Change Dump) file. This file contains all the signal changes that happened during the simulation. To view these signals as waveforms, we use GTKWave, a tool that helps us analyze and debug our design.

Steps to View Waveforms in GTKWave

Run the Simulation
First, make sure you have already run the simulation using: ./iiitb_rv32i

This command generates a file called iiitb_rv32i.vcd, which stores the signal changes.

Open GTKWave
To view the waveforms, enter: gtkwave iiitb_rv32i.vcd

This will open GTKWave and load the saved signal data.

Understanding the GTKWave Window
Once GTKWave opens, you will see different sections: Signals Panel (left side): Lists all the signals from your simulation. Waveform Viewer (right side): Shows how signals change over time. Time Scale (top): Represents time steps in the simulation.

Adding Signals to the Waveform Viewer
To observe how different signals change: Find the signals (like pc, instr, or reg_file) in the Signals Panel. Drag and drop them into the Waveform Viewer or right-click and select Insert into Waveform.

Analyzing the Waveforms
Program Counter (pc): Helps track which instruction is being executed. Instruction Register (instr): Shows which instruction is currently running. Registers and Data Paths: Help check if the CPU is working correctly.

Adjusting the View
Zoom In/Out: Use the zoom buttons to focus on specific time intervals. Scroll Along Time: Drag left or right to see how values change at different clock cycles.

Why Use GTKWave? GTKWave helps us visualize whatâ€™s happening inside the CPU step by step. It is useful for debugging and ensuring that the instructions are executed correctly.
